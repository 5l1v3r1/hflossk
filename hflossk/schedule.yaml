# How to use:
#  Items in a week are grouped together under week #X
#  a class has a classnumber and an automatic date
#  anything that fits in an href
#  both of these take the same arguments as topics.
#  and all three are optional.
#
#  You can have as many parts to topics, assign, or due as
#  you like.
#
#  An extra identifier 'date' may be used to specify the date
#  of an event or move a single class.
#
#  In addition to name and link, special can be used to style
#  sections. Options include 'cancelled', 'guest', 'tba',
#  'hackathon', and others.
