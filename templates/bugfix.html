<h1>Homework - Bugfix<a class="headerlink" href="#homework-bugfix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Real learning in computing comes more from doing and less from studying.
Debugging, figuring out how some software works and how it doesn&#8217;t, is an
interactive process that develops basic engineering practices and, in the open
source context, community engagement and collaboration.</p>
<div class="section" id="find-a-bug">
<h2>Find a bug<a class="headerlink" href="#find-a-bug" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A bug can be anything: an unintended side-effect in a low-level routine, a
user-interface cleanup, a feature enhancement, grammatical errors or lack of
clarity in the project&#8217;s documentation.</p>
<p>Broadly, you have two different options here.  You can</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Find a known bug (or feature enhancement) listed in the project&#8217;s bug
tracker.</li>
<li>Find a bug yourself by using the software.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In the event of the second case, make sure you file the bug in the project&#8217;s
tracker before proceeding.</p>
<p>You can fix a bug in any project you like.  The best to pick is something you <em>already
use</em>, something with which you&#8217;re already familiar.  If you can&#8217;t think of any
projects to investigate off the top of your head, here&#8217;s a list of suggestions.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Scope the OpenHatch Volunteer Opportunity Finder for
<a class="reference external" href="http://openhatch.org/search/?toughness=bitesize">Bite-sized Bugs</a></li>
<li>Check out the "easy-fix" bugs <a target="_blank" href="https://fedoraproject.org/easyfix">Listed by the Fedora Project</a></li>
<li>Use the search function at <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com/">http://github.com/</a> and filter by language (to a
language that you know).</li>
<li>Look up some of the bounties at Gun.io <a class="reference external" href="http://gun.io/">http://gun.io/</a></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Really, the sky is the limit here.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">For background, you might want to also check out the project on
<a class="reference external" href="http://ohloh.net/">http://ohloh.net/</a>.  It can help you characterize what kind of community
orbits around your choice.</p>

<h2>Use the Source, Luke<a class="headerlink" href="#use-the-source-luke" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve identified a bug that needs fixing, you&#8217;ll need to get ahold of the
source.  In most cases, the code for a project will be hosted on a forge and the
process of forking and cloning the source will be straightforward.   If you
forget how to do this for <a class="reference external" href="http://github.com">github</a>, you can refer to
<a class="reference internal" href="fflight.html"><em>Homework - First Flight</em></a>.</p>
<p>For whatever project you&#8217;ve chosen, you should ask that project&#8217;s community for
help.  Look for <cite>IRC</cite> channels and project mailing lists.  You&#8217;ll be
communicating with developers who have a lot on their plate so make sure to <a class="reference external" href="http://maymay.net/blog/2009/02/11/how-to-start-contributing-to-open-source-projects/">be
polite and leave your ego at the door</a>.</p>
<p>Find the code related to the bug; use whatever code navigation tools you&#8217;re
more familiar with.  The instructor&#8217;s favorite method is:  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">grep</span> <span class="pre">-inr</span> <span class="pre">&quot;some</span>
<span class="pre">string&quot;</span> <span class="pre">project_src/</span></tt>.</p>
<p>Fix the bug, this may require some thinking, and some more asking around.</p>
<p>Test your fix!  Project maintainers hate nothing more than receiving a patch
that breaks every other function of the project.  Often, projects have built-in
test suites.  If yours does, run it!</p>
<p>Prepare your patch with descriptive commit messages.  Follow the method for
submitting patches recommended by your project and submit!</p>
<p>Make sure the project community can easily understand what you did and
why you did it.</p>
<p>Make sure there is a reference in the tracked bug ticket to your patch (that is,
if the project maintains a bug tracker).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-deliverable">
<h2>The Deliverable<a class="headerlink" href="#the-deliverable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Write a blog post about this process and provide relevant links where
possible to documentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>A link to the patch(es) hosted somewhere on the web, usually forges provide
the ability to link to changesets.</li>
<li>A link to any mailing list discussions archived on the web</li>
<li>Snippets of any relevant IRC conversations.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You will be graded on your post and the explanation of your process.  Extra
kudos (but not extra credit) for super epic patches.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="an-afterthought-not-required">
<h2>An Afterthought (not required)<a class="headerlink" href="#an-afterthought-not-required" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once your patch has been accepted, mosey on over to <a class="reference external" href="http://ohloh.net">http://ohloh.net</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Create an account</li>
<li>Find the project you patched<ul>
<li>If it doesn&#8217;t exist, you can add it yourself</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>&#8220;Claim your position&#8221; as the author of the commit(s) you sent in to increase
your rank among open source developers of the world!</li>
</ul>
